DESCRIPTION
This plugin provides commands and functions to set up regions in the current
buffer that either use a syntax different from the buffer's 'filetype', or
completely ignore the syntax.

SOURCE
The code to include a different syntax in a region is based on
    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Different_syntax_highlighting_within_regions_of_a_file

USAGE
For quick, ad-hoc manipulation of the syntax withing a range of lines, the
following commands are provided:

:[range]SyntaxIgnore    Ignore the buffer's filetype syntax for the current
                        line / lines in [range]. (Top-level keywords will
                        still be highlighted.)
                        This can be a useful fix when some text fragments
                        confuse the syntax highlighting. (For example, when
                        buffer syntax set to an inlined here-document is
                        negatively affected by the foreign code surrounding
                        the here-document.)

:[range]SyntaxInclude {filetype}
                        Use the {filetype} syntax for the current line / lines
                        in [range].

                        Line numbers in [range] are fixed; i.e. they do not
                        adapt to inserted / deleted lines. But when in a
                        range, the last line ($) is interpreted as "end of
                        file".


For finer control and use in custom mappings or syntax tweaks, the following
functions can be used. You'll find the details directly in the
.vim/autoload/SyntaxRange.vim implementation file.

SyntaxRange#Include( startPattern, endPattern, filetype, ... )
                        Use the {filetype} syntax for the region defined by
                        {startPattern} and {endPattern}.
SyntaxRange#IncludeEx( regionDefinition, filetype )
                        Use the {filetype} syntax for the region defined by
                        {regionDefinition}.
